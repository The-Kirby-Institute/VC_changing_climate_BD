# Vectorial capacity of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in Bangladesh

This repository contains all the code and processed climate data (except observed weather station data) to calculate vectorial capacity of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in Bangladesh for the period 1950-2099. The outputs of this calculation are reported in an article titled *Dengue transmission risk in a changing climate: Bangladesh could experience a longer dengue fever season in the future*


All codes were created and run using R statistical software version 4.0.2 and Rstudio version 1.3.1056 with associated packages (ncdf4 1.17; tidyverse 1.3.0; reshape2 1.4.4; raster 3.3-7; RColorBrewer 1.1-2; grid 4.0.2; rgdal 1.5-12; cowplot 1.1.1). Some of the data files required to run the scripts are not publicly available and have been excluded from the repository (but can be available on Request). Please report an issue if you want to run the code or contact either Kpaul@kirby.unsw.edu.au or Rgray@kirby.unsw.edu.au.
